    This simple website was originally made to practice CSS, HTML, and JavaScript as well as to practice Front-End developer skills such as UI, aesthetic design, and general accessibility.
    The aesthetics were heavily influenced by the classic, old-school terminals as well as the hit video-game series Fallout for a highly aesthetic, maximal look. In the end, it escalated to the site you see before you.
